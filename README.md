# Asset Pricing Model

## Project Overview
This repository contains the development and implementation of an advanced asset pricing model that integrates key financial theories and empirical research findings to predict asset returns and analyze market anomalies. The model explores concepts from the efficient frontier, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and behavioral finance.

### Key Features
- **Efficient Frontier**: Analyzes portfolios to determine the best possible returns for a given level of risk according to modern portfolio theory.
- **CAPM**: Utilizes the Capital Asset Pricing Model to estimate the expected returns of assets based on their risk relative to the market.
- **Behavioral Finance Factors**: Incorporates insights from behavioral finance to account for anomalies that traditional asset pricing models might overlook, such as investor psychology and market sentiment.

### Objectives
The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive tool for forecasting asset returns, aiding investment decision-making, and enhancing the understanding of how market anomalies can affect asset pricing.
